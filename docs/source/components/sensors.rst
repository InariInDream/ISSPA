**Preface**
-----------

The proper deployment and standardized use of sensors are crucial for the stable operation of autonomous 
vehicles, as the quality of their data significantly impacts the safety of vehicle navigation. 
In the field of autonomous driving, the array of sensors typically includes industrial cameras, LiDAR, 
mm-wave radar, GPS, IMU, each with distinct data formats.

**ISSPA's configuration**
-------------------------

ISSPA's vehicles can be equipped with single/multi-line LiDAR, mono/stereo cameras, IMU, 
providing researchers with a diverse range of options to meet their specific needs. 
Brief introductions to different sensors are as follows: 

- LiDAR: LiDAR utilizes laser beams to measure precise distances by measuring the reflection time. 
  Widely used in autonomous driving, LiDAR contributes to real-time mapping, obstacle detection, 
  and distance measurement.

- Industrial Camera: Industrial cameras, known for high resolution and fast capture rates, 
  are employed for capturing image information. In autonomous driving, 
  industrial cameras are utilized for visual perception, lane detection, 
  traffic sign recognition, and other tasks.

- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): IMU provides information about a vehicle's attitude and motion 
  state by measuring acceleration and angular velocity. In autonomous driving systems, 
  IMU is commonly used to enhance navigation accuracy and stability.
