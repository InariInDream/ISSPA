Welcome to ISSPA's documentation!
===================================

**ISSPA** is an experimental platform for self-driving physical agents, which was originally designed to facilitate researchers by creating a benchmark library that is easy to use, algorithmically verifiable, and modularly extensible. Its full name is **Intelligent Self-driving System empowering Physical Agent**, and it was built under the leadership of the [TIS](https://tis.ios.ac.cn/) lab, of which the team members are listed in :doc:`Team`.

It has the following main features:
1. Some benchmark frameworks for autonomous driving, with algorithms that are easy to validate (with convenient interfaces).
2, A supporting cloud platform that allows remote connection and use of physical carts.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
