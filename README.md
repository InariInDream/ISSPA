# ISSPA (Intelligent Self-driving System empowering Physical Agents)

## Introduction
**ISSPA** is an experimental platform for self-driving physical agents, which was originally designed to 
facilitate researchers by creatingbaseline solutions that are easy to use, algorithmically verifiable, and 
modularly extensible. And it was built under the leadership of the [TIS Lab](https://tis.ios.ac.cn/), of which 
the team members are listed in [Team](https://isspa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about_us/team.html).

ISSPA has the following features:

- Some baseline solutions for autonomous driving.

- Cloud platform that supports the remote use of physical vehicles.
